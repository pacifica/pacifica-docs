# About Pacifica

## History

Pacifica was created from a collaboration in the
[United States National Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy_national_laboratories)
system. The Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory ([EMSL](https://www.emsl.pnnl.gov))
collaborated with its host institution Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
([PNNL](https://www.pnnl.gov)) to help manage the scientific data generated
by researchers.

EMSL is a [user facility](https://www.energy.gov/science/science-innovation/office-science-user-facilities)
sponsored by the Department of Energy ([DOE](https://www.energy.gov))
Office of Science ([here](https://www.energy.gov/science)) Biological and
Environmental Research ([BER](https://www.energy.gov/science/ber/biological-and-environmental-research)).

Pacifica was created by EMSL and PNNL in response to 
[DOE Data Management Policy](https://www.energy.gov/datamanagement/doe-policy-digital-research-data-management)
to manage open research data to make it more transparent. EMSL and
PNNL both have similar administrative problems in that a single
project can not shoulder the burden of meeting the policy on its
own. This brought both EMSL and PNNL to the table to collaborate on
developing an institutional data management system for open research
science.

## The Data Management Challenge

The challenge is defined within the nexus of a large institution's
operating model, and the data policies the institution is required
to follow.

### DOE Data Management Policy

The DOE Data Management policy covers a lot, but we will only highlight
the guiding principles here.

#### Effective Data Management

```
 1. Effective data management has the potential to increase the pace of
    scientific discovery and promote more efficient and effective use of
    government funding and resources. Data management planning should be
    an integral part of research planning.
```

Pacifica addresses these challenges by offering an effective mechanism
for data sharing, thus maximizing the impact of research across all
participating organizations.

#### Sharing Proves Integrity

```
 2. Sharing and preserving data are central to protecting the integrity of
    science by facilitating validation of results and to advancing science
    by broadening the value of research data to disciplines other than the
    originating one and to society at large. To the greatest extent, with
    the fewest constraints possible, and consistent with the requirements
    and other principles stated in this document, data sharing should make
    digital research data available to and useful for the scientific
    community, industry, and the public.
```

Sharing scientific data with the public proves the scientific work being done
is of the highest integrity. A dependency of this is to share the software
system managing the data in an open source model. Without an open source 
software model the integrity of the data and the science could be suspect.
This is why Pacifica is an open source software project.

#### Preserve What You Can

```
 3. Not all data need to be shared or preserved. The costs and benefits of
    doing so should be considered in data management planning.
```

The task of sharing and preserving all data generated by open science is
costly, especially for small projects. The overhead required to adhere to
meeting the policy must be addressed by the supporting institution.

### The Operating Model

The operating model for research institutions is largely project based.
Projects have many properties, each bounded depending on the institutions
needs. The properties include: dollar amount, hours, resources, funding
chain, authority to operate, scope, etc.

While a project operating model reflects the how an organization parses out
project funds, it does not reflect the evolution of scientific data. In
order to understand what data were created within the full project scope,
including related projects and sub-tasks, a system needs to be integrated
in the project from initiation to end. Pacifica can fill that requirement.

### The Scientific Data Life-Cycle

The scientific data life-cycle more closely maps to a tree or bush. The
start of the tree extends back in time. Each branch of the tree a piece
of scientific data critical to supporting science being done today. The
leaves of the branch represent the cutting edge of science. Some leaves
prove to be more sturdy than others and go on to grow into their own
branch. The most important part of the analogy is that the tree did
start from somewhere, and we know a little about the immediate future.
However, the sky is the limit and we do not know how big the tree will
grow. So, we need to keep the knowledge and data generated in the past
preserved to keep the tree strong and healthy.
