Collaborate. Share. Integrate. Build. 
Pacifica supports the scientific data lifecycle.

### Data Management

Scientific Data Management systems for research and development
institutions need to provide uncomplicated solutions to meet 
often complicated problems. Pacifica offers institutions a
platform to collaboratively manage data between projects.
Pacifica can accelerate the scientific process by making search
and discovery tractable solutions.

### How to Solve it

Open source does not end with the release of the source code.
Complex problems require the community to share ideas, processes,
and support features to solve the requirements -- the evolution
from open source, to open everything. Pacifica is governed by an
open everything community.

### Impact

Pacifica seeks to enable institutions to reduce risk while
accelerating scientific impact for all its users. Pacifica has
interfaces to allow scientists to automate workflow, improving
quality and reuse of their research. Pacifica is open source and
allows contributions from development and operator teams.
