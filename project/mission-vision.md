## Mission

To provide institutions a foundation to support the scientific data
life cycle.

## Vision

We will become a focal point for institutions to collaborate, share
scientific data, integrate new technologies, and develop their
research portfolio. We will enable institutions to meet and exceed
emerging sponsor data challenges, while maintaining promises kept
in the past. We will provide the platform to accellerate scientific
research in directions never thought possible.
